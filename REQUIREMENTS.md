# Context

This application is designed to handle a gym enterprise. Each enterprise will have an instance of this application. Each enterprise can have multiple gyms, customers (who can join any of the enterprise’s gyms), and employees.
To enroll in the enterprise as a customer, you choose from different rates that are global for all gyms. When a customer enrolls, a contract is created between the enterprise, the customer, and the chosen rate, plus additional information about the employee and gym where the contract was signed.

This application will have a back office (admin panel) that allows the manager to handle the aspects of the enterprise described above.

# Functional Requirements

## Core

- You should see all gyms in the enterprise, and update, create, and delete them. You can filter gyms by core criteria such as name, location, and others.
- You should list all employees, and update, create, and delete them. In addition, you can assign each employee to the gym where they work. Core filters are supported as well.
- You should list all rates, and update, create, and delete them. Essential filters should be supported.
- Contracts should be accessible in read-only mode from a specific customer. You can also finish (close) a contract. Finishing a contract is required before you can delete that customer.

## Additional

- Show a ranking of employees who have recruited the most customers per month (with month selector).
- Show an analytics page with useful insights: top 3 gyms by number of customers, total gyms, total employees, total customers, top 3 most popular rates, and average new customers per month.
- A real-time notification when a new customer has signed a new contract.

# Non Functional Requirements

## Core

- Entity deletion should be logical deletion (soft delete)
- SPA as web application
- Independent backend to give support to web application
- Unit Test coverage >80% (frontend and backend)

## Additional

- E2E backend tests
- Real time "event bus"
- API First on backend
- Autogenerated API Documentation on backend
- Backend pipeline that does not allow merging PRs until it succeeds: unit tests passed, E2E tests passed, and unit test coverage >80%.
